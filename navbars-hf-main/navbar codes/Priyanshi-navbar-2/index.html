      <p>A navigation bar is a section of a graphical user interface intended to aid visitors in accessing information. Navigation bars are implemented in file browsers, web browsers and as a design element of some web sites. 
        A web browser navigation bar includes the back and forward buttons, as well as the Location bar where URLs are entered.[3] Formerly the functionality of the navigation bar was split between the browser's toolbar and the address bar, but Google Chrome introduced the practice of merging the two. Some early versions of Netscape used the HTML link tag to construct a navigation bar to navigate web sites.[4] Today the nav tag can be used for the same purpose.
